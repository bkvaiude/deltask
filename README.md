#Deltask: Bob The Buider

##Technology used for completing the task are:

[CakePHP](http://www.cakephp.org) - The rapid development PHP framework
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
[Bootstrap Template](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/navbar/) 
LocalStorage for storing temp json data
jQuery and its plugins

About project or task given to me:

I am trying accomplish both tasks using project.

Here is my understanding for the project task:

I think we are trying to develop the **Facebook Farmville** kind of game.
I am trying to develop here backend services for that game.

I have imagine game flow in following way

1. User will land on page and login to our system through the ~~oauth~~ system
1. User will get 50 golds as joining bonus and he can start creating cities and building into the cities
1. User can choose three type of cities 
    1. 'Smart City (50 golds)',
    1. 'Mid Level City (20 golds)',
    1. 'Normal (10 golds)'
1. Same for buildings with 4 rooms on each floor
    1. 'Low (7 floors, 5 golds)',
    1. 'Medium (12 floors, 10 golds)',
    1. 'High (more than 15 floors, 15 golds)
1. Activities: User must need to performance maintainance, upgradation and creating new city/buidling activities with fixed periodic time
1. If user fail to do so then he will need to pay fine in of golds and bad reputation points 
1. If user always active and performing activities then he will receive the bonus gold and reputation points


UI 
1. admin credentials admin/admin fixed for now
1. admin can see the created cities and stats for each city
1. create new user if required

Web services (will return the json output)
1. Create city
1. Create building


As this things are not totally got covered in the 3 hour test, but I have tried my best.

thanks,
